## Opening
This is the source code of Muhammad Faran Aiki's personal website.
His social media:
1. X/Twitter: https://x.com/FaranAiki
2. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-faran-aiki-8a6305343/

## The usage of this page
I made this page so that I can share my LIFE. Most people do not care, but I do not care about the uncareness of them.
However, there are some real benefits of creating this page, such as 
* College: this is where I share most of my college assignments so people can learn

## Motivation
One of my friends in the same faculty as mine (School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics - Computation) inspired me to make a personal website. So, I said, why not?

## What I have learned
I learned
1. How to use ReactJS + NextJS + Tailwind 
2. How to use AI at its maximum potential
3. How to do debug properly
4. How to use API, such as YouTube (using Google APIS in backend)
5. How to use Gemini API
6. The real difference between client-side (POST method) and server-side ("use client")
7. Error handling

## Template 
The first version (scratch and template) is generated using Gemini with the prompt of 
>buatlah website untuk personal dengan menu:
>
>About Me
>Music
>Technology
>College Collections
>Publishing and Literature
>dan dengan satu menu popup yang berjudul "Ask me about anything" dengan textbox dan tombol submit di bawah kiri
>Menggunakan next.js dan tailwind dengan fail yang terpisah untuk github

Other than that, the website is made by me for a simple project.
